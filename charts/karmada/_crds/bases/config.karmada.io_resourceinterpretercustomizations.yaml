                description: Retention describes the desired behavior that karmada
                  should react on the changes made by member cluster components. This
                  avoids system running into a meaningless loop that Karmada resource
                  controller and the member cluster component continually applying
                  opposite values of a field. For example, the "replicas" of Deployment
                  might be changed by the HPA controller on member cluster. In this
                  case, Karmada should retain the "replicas" and not try to change
                  it.
